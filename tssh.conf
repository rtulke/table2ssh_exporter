# tssh.conf - Default SSH Configuration Template
# Place in: ~/.conf/tssh.ssh, ~/.tssh.conf, ~/tssh.conf, tssh.conf, or .tssh.conf
#
# This file is a template that can be used with all configurations supported 
# by your SSH client. See also: https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config
#
# It is important to note that the file is divided into two sections: [global] and [host_defaults]. 
# As with the actual configuration, variables that are defined globally are 
# defined in [global], and variables that only refer to [host_defaults] are defined there.

[global]
# Global settings applied to all hosts (Host * block)
# Connection multiplexing for better performance
ControlMaster = auto
ControlPath = ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
ControlPersist = 600

# Keep connections alive
ServerAliveInterval = 60
ServerAliveCountMax = 3

# Lab-friendly settings (disable for production!)
StrictHostKeyChecking = no
UserKnownHostsFile = /dev/null

# Connection and performance
ConnectTimeout = 10
Compression = yes

[host_defaults]
# Default settings for each individual host
IdentityFile = ~/.ssh/id_rsa
IdentitiesOnly = yes
PasswordAuthentication = no
PubkeyAuthentication = yes

# Uncomment for specific needs:
# Port = 22
# User = admin
# LogLevel = INFO
# ForwardAgent = yes
# ForwardX11 = no
